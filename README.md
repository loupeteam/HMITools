# Description
The HMITools library creates easy interaction functionalities with Visual Components and the HMI.

Overview

Having a well designed operator interface that is easy to use can greatly advance efficiency and safety in a manufacturing process. Development of a intuitive HMI can add a significant amount of time and can be very tedious to design and implement.

HMITools library was developed to give more tedious functionalities a simple and clean interface from your program to the HMI. This allows a significant decrease in development time and increases usability for the operator.

# Usage
The HMITools functionality can be integrated into any project using a couple of data structures and a few function block calls.
